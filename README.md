# Fake Job Verification System
AI-Powered Fake Job Verification System
# Overview
An intelligent system that uses machine learning to detect and verify legitimate job postings, protecting job seekers from fraudulent listings.

# Features
- ML-based Detection:** Uses NLP and pattern recognition to identify fake job postings
- Real-time Verification**: Instant analysis of job descriptions and company details
- Risk Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for job legitimacy
- Company Verification**: Cross-references with legitimate company databases
- User Dashboard**: Clean interface for job seekers to check postings

# Technology Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask, scikit-learn, NLTK
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- ML Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- API Integration: Company verification APIs

# Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-job-verification.git
cd fake-job-verification
```
2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Installed dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set up the database
```bash
python setup_db.py
```
5. Train the model (optional - pre-trained model included)
```bash
python train_model.py
```
6. Run the application
```bash
python run.py
```
# API Usage
```python
import requests
#Verify a job posting
response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/verify', json={
    'job_title': 'Software Engineer',
    'company': 'Tech Corp',
    'description': 'Looking for experienced developer...',
    'salary': '50000-80000',
    'location': 'New York, NY'
})

result = response.json()
print(f"Legitimacy Score: {result['score']}")
print(f"Risk Level: {result['risk_level']}")
```
# Machine Learning Model
# Features Used
- Text Analysis: Job description sentiment, keyword frequency, grammar quality
- Company Verification: Domain validation, company registration status
- Salary Analysis: Salary range vs. market standards
- Contact Information: Email domain analysis, phone number validation
- Posting Patterns: Urgency indicators, unrealistic promises

# Model Performance
- Accuracy: 94.2%
- Precision: 92.8%
- Recall: 95.1%
- F1-Score: 93.9%

# Training Data
The model was trained on 50,000+ job postings with verified labels:
- 30,000 legitimate job postings
- 20,000 identified fake postings

# Key Algorithms
1. Text Classification
```python
#Simplified example of the main classification logic
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def classify_job_posting(text):
    # Vectorize the job description
    tfidf_vector = vectorizer.transform([text])
    
    # Predict legitimacy
    prediction = model.predict(tfidf_vector)
    probability = model.predict_proba(tfidf_vector)
    
    return prediction[0], probability[0]
```
2. Company Verification
```python
def verify_company(company_name, email_domain):
    #Check against registered companies database
    #Validate email domain
    #Cross-reference with business registries
    verification_score = calculate_company_score(company_name, email_domain)
    return verification_score
```
